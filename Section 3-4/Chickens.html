        <p>
            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl, with attributes of
            wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
            is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is
            a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
        </p>

        <p>
            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[11][12]

                Other terms are:

                Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
                Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
                Chick: a young chicken[15]
                Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
                Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17]
                Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18]
                Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
                immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20]
                Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21]
                Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage
                on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
                American English. In older sources, chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic
                fowl.[22]

                Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
            as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[24][25][26] and is widely used
            throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[27]</p>
